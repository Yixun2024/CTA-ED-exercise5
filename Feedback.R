# Feedback: CTA exercise 5 (2024)

# question 1
# -----------------------------------------------------------
# the code is fine but you didn't explain your choice of books

# question 2
# -----------------------------------------------------------
# again the code is fine but there is no interpretation of the analyses or results

# question 3
# -----------------------------------------------------------
# you didn't actually run the PreText analyses, and therefore also didn't interpret the outputs.

# overall code quality: 
# -----------------------------------------------------------
# Overall you re-used the exercise code pretty well
# But you need to knit your document in order for me to assess it
# you also need to comment your code more (using in-code comments preceded by hashtags)
# make sure code chunks that you want to run do not have 'eval=FALSE' in the code chunk specification: that line tells R not to run this code chunk. This is what happened with the PreText analysis.


# overall interpretation: 
# -----------------------------------------------------------
# You didn't include any interpretation; this is a non-negotiable for the final assignment. 
# If you only run the code but do not explain what the analyses means for the text and how to interpret 
# and learn from the results and the modelling, then your assignment will be failed... 
# Make sure you focus a lot more on interpretation and analyses in your final assignment!
